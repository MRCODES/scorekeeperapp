Purpose
I built this app to challenge myself to learn react usestate. 

Result
Created a scoreboard app with plus, minus, reset buttons for each player 
score. 

Code
Used UseState to store functions/data. Two increment functions 
on click and one reset function that resets back to 0 on a click. 

Design
I drew custom + and - chalk buttons and the chalk logo, 
created in Adobe Illustrator.

Issues
Initially I didn't have a reset but figured out that just changing the 
value to "0" resets the score board scores.
